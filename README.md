# Roundtable CRM (RTable)

The Roundtable Customer Relationship Manager.

STATUS: JUST STARTED

The goal is to create a simple CRM based on the idea of nouns and verbs. A noun is a [person, place, or thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0m89e9oZko) â€” or idea. We call nouns cards which can represent people, organizations, structures, equipment, inventory.

A [verb is an action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EicxQxzsW4) based around a ticket system.

We connect tickets with cards to create a graph of information.
