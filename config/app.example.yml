# App.yml Example
#
# Save production block to server:app/shared/config/app.yml
production:
  domains:
    # Physical domain to lookup on all requests
    examplecrm.com:
      # Domain ID should be an integer
      id: 1
      # Display name for site
      name: Example CRM

# Save development/test to development config/app.yml
development:
  domains:
    # You can use localhost if you only have one tenant
    # However, you can use any subdomain.crzy.me because
    # *.crzy.me resolves to 127.0.0.1
    example.crzy.me:
      # The ID matches the production domain above
      id: 1
      # Repeat production name or not, it's up to you
      name: Example CRM (dev)

# Placeholder domain for testing
test:
  domains:
    # All spec tests set domain to www.example.com
    # Just go with it
    www.example.com:
      id: 1
      name: Example CRM (test)
